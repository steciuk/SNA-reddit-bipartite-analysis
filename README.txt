In case there are any issues with opening the notebook itself I also attach 'project.html' which is the notebook exported to html format.
Note it must be kept in the same directory as 'img' in order for images to display properly.

I also attach 'requirements.txt' with the snapshot of all the python packages, their dependencies and versions, that were used in the project.
