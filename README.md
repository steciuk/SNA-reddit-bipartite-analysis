Project for the Social Network Analysis course at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Valencia, during the spring semester of 2023.

**Project supervisors:** Miguel Rebollo Pedruelo, Joaquim Francesco Arlandis Navarro  
**Grade:** 10/10

## Project description

The aim of the project was to gather, process, analyze, visualize, and interpret any data from a real-world social network. I decided to analyze the Reddit social network, which is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

All instructions, code, descriptions, and results can be found in the [**project notebook**](project.ipynb) or in a generated [**HTML file**](https://steciuk.github.io/SNA-reddit-bipartite-analysis/).

The project was created using Python 3.10.10. All required packages can be found in the [**requirements file**](requirements.txt).
